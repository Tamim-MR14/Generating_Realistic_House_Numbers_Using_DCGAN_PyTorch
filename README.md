# Generating_Realistic_House_Numbers_Using_DCGAN_PyTorch
 Did this project in "Generative Adversarial Networks" module during completion of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. Defined Deep Convolutional Discriminator and generator network using Convolutional, transpose Convolutionala and batch Normalization layer. Trained the dicriminator network optimizing combined discriminator loss on real and fake images using true labels and trained the generator network optimizing discriminator loss on fake images using flipped labels to train the entir GAN on Google SVHN dataset to generate realistic looking house number images.
